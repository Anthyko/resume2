## ℹ️ About This Project

This website is a personal portfolio built using Astrolio, an open-source one-page resume/portfolio template designed with Astro.

The original template includes features such as:

- JSON-based CV integration (JSON Resume schema)
- Command Palette for quick navigation
- Built-in PDF export

I have adapted the template to fit my needs and personal style. You can learn more about the original project and its creator below.
